<h1>GLASSES</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Yes indeed, I say to myself, pen in hand, I can keep hold of the
thread and let it lead me back to the first impression.&nbsp; The little
story is all there, I can touch it from point to point; for the thread,
as I call it, is a row of coloured beads on a string.&nbsp; None of
the beads are missing&mdash;at least I think they&rsquo;re not: that&rsquo;s
exactly what I shall amuse myself with finding out.</p>
<p>I had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down
to Folkestone for a blow.&nbsp; Art was long, I felt, and my holiday
short; my mother was settled at Folkestone, and I paid her a visit when
I could.&nbsp; I remember how on this occasion, after weeks in my stuffy
studio with my nose on my palette, I sniffed up the clean salt air and
cooled my eyes with the purple sea.&nbsp; The place was full of lodgings,
and the lodgings were at that season full of people, people who had
nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down.&nbsp;
There were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little Jews;
and there was music in an open rotunda, over which the little Jews wagged
their big noses.&nbsp; We all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths
of rest; the long, level cliff-top, edged in places with its iron rail,
might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship.&nbsp; There were old
folks in Bath chairs, and there was one dear chair, creeping to its
last full stop, by the side of which I always walked.&nbsp; There was
in fine weather the coast of France to look at, and there were the usual
things to say about it; there was also in every state of the atmosphere
our friend Mrs. Meldrum, a subject of remark not less inveterate.&nbsp;
The widow of an officer in the Engineers, she had settled, like many
members of the martial miscellany, well within sight of the hereditary
enemy, who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference
of their years a close alliance with my mother.&nbsp; She was the heartiest,
the keenest, the ugliest of women, the least apologetic, the least morbid
in her misfortune.&nbsp; She carried it high aloft with loud sounds
and free gestures, made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the
flag of her country.&nbsp; It consisted mainly of a big red face, indescribably
out of drawing, from which she glared at you through gold-rimmed aids
to vision, optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced
that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against
the glass of her spectacles.&nbsp; She was extraordinarily near-sighted,
and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the
kind eyes behind them.&nbsp; Blest conveniences they were, in their
hideous, honest strength&mdash;they showed the good lady everything
in the world but her own queerness.&nbsp; This element was enhanced
by wild braveries of dress, reckless charges of colour and stubborn
resistances of cut, wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet
seemed to lay down its life.&nbsp; She had the tread of a grenadier
and the voice of an angel.</p>
<p>In the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival I found
myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity.&nbsp; I had
been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and I was still
more affected when I saw the face, at the sight of my companion, open
like a window thrown wide.&nbsp; A smile fluttered out of it an brightly
as a drapery dropped from a sill&mdash;a drapery shaken there in the
sun by a young lady flanked by two young men, a wonderful young lady
who, as we drew nearer, rushed up to Mrs. Meldrum with arms flourished
for an embrace.&nbsp; My immediate impression of her had been that she
was dressed in mourning, but during the few moments she stood talking
with our friend I made more discoveries.&nbsp; The figure from the neck
down was meagre, the stature insignificant, but the desire to please
towered high, as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never,
never missing it.&nbsp; This was a little person whom I would have made
a high bid for a good chance to paint.&nbsp; The head, the features,
the colour, the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity;
the deep grey eyes&mdash;the most agreeable, I thought, that I had ever
seen&mdash;brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered.&nbsp;
Their possessor was just back from Boulogne, where she had spent a week
with dear Mrs. Floyd-Taylor: this accounted for the effusiveness of
her reunion with dear Mrs. Meldrum.&nbsp; Her black garments were of
the freshest and daintiest; she suggested a pink-and-white wreath at
a showy funeral.&nbsp; She confounded us for three minutes with her
presence; she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible
order.&nbsp; The young men, her companions, gazed at her and grinned:
I could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men,
these or others, would not be so occupied.&nbsp; The people who approached
took leave of their manners; every one seemed to linger and gape.&nbsp;
When she brought her face close to Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s&mdash;and she
appeared to be always bringing it close to somebody&rsquo;s&mdash;it
was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general
identity, the unmistakable character of the English gentlewoman.&nbsp;
Mrs. Meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage, but I
wondered why she didn&rsquo;t introduce me: I should have had no objection
to the bringing of such a face close to mine.&nbsp; However, by the
time the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed
me a sense that some such <i>rapprochement</i> might still occur.&nbsp;
Was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at Folkestone,
or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of
the rights, on the part of others, that such beauty as hers created?&nbsp;
I was in a position to answer that question after Mrs. Meldrum had answered
a few of mine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Flora Saunt, the only daughter of an old soldier, had lost both her
parents, her mother within a few months.&nbsp; Mrs. Meldrum had known
them, disapproved of them, considerably avoided them: she had watched
the girl, off and on, from her early childhood.&nbsp; Flora, just twenty,
was extraordinarily alone in the world&mdash;so alone that she had no
natural chaperon, no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger, Mrs.
Hammond Synge, the sister-in-law of one of the young men I had just
seen.&nbsp; She had lots of friends, but none of them nice: she kept
picking up impossible people.&nbsp; The Floyd-Taylors, with whom she
had been at Boulogne, were simply horrid.&nbsp; The Hammond Synges were
perhaps not so vulgar, but they had no conscience in their dealings
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows what I think of them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meldrum,
&ldquo;and indeed she knows what I think of most things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shares that privilege with most of your friends!&rdquo;
I replied laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little
difference.&nbsp; That girl doesn&rsquo;t care a button.&nbsp; She knows
best of all what I think of Flora Saunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may your opinion be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that she&rsquo;s not worth troubling about&mdash;an
idiot too abysmal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she care for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just enough, as you saw, to hug me till I cry out.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
too pleased with herself for anything else to matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, my dear friend,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;she has
a good deal to be pleased with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So every one tells her, and so you would have told her if
I had given you the chance.&nbsp; However, that doesn&rsquo;t signify
either, for her vanity is beyond all making or mending.&nbsp; She believes
in herself, and she&rsquo;s welcome, after all, poor dear, having only
herself to look to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seldom met a young woman more completely
free to be silly.&nbsp; She has a clear course&mdash;she&rsquo;ll make
a showy finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as she probably will reduce
many persons to the same degraded state, her partaking of it won&rsquo;t
stand out so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that the world&rsquo;s full of twaddlers I quite
agree with you!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Meldrum, trumpeting her laugh half
across the Channel.</p>
<p>I had after this to consider a little what she would call my mother&rsquo;s
son, but I didn&rsquo;t let it prevent me from insisting on her making
me acquainted with Flora Saunt; indeed I took the bull by the horns,
urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity
now demanded of her to put into relation with a character really fine.&nbsp;
Such a frail creature was just an object of pity.&nbsp; This contention
on my part had at first of course been jocular; but strange to say it
was quite the ground I found myself taking with regard to our young
lady after I had begun to know her.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have said
what I felt about her except that she was undefended; from the first
of my sitting with her there after dinner, under the stars&mdash;that
was a week at Folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded
chairs&mdash;I became aware both that protection was wholly absent from
her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence.&nbsp; The
odd thing was that she was not appealing: she was abjectly, divinely
conceited, absurdly fantastically pleased.&nbsp; Her beauty was as yet
all the world to her, a world she had plenty to do to live in.&nbsp;
Mrs. Meldrum told me more about her, and there was nothing that, as
the centre of a group of giggling, nudging spectators, Flora wasn&rsquo;t
ready to tell about herself.&nbsp; She held her little court in the
crowd, upon the grass, playing her light over Jews and Gentiles, completely
at ease in all promiscuities.&nbsp; It was an effect of these things
that from the very first, with every one listening, I could mention
that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head
and to arrange in that view for an early sitting.&nbsp; It would have
been as impossible, I think, to be impertinent to her as it would have
been to throw a stone at a plate-glass window; so any talk that went
forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in
the world and immediately became the most general and sociable.&nbsp;
It was when I saw all this that I judged how, though it was the last
thing she asked for, what one would ever most have at her service was
a curious compassion.&nbsp; That sentiment was coloured by the vision
of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard.&nbsp;
Hers was the only vanity I have ever known that made its possessor superlatively
soft.&nbsp; Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s further information contributed moreover
to these indulgences&mdash;her account of the girl&rsquo;s neglected
childhood and queer continental relegations, with straying squabbling
Monte-Carlo-haunting parents; the more invidious picture, above all,
of her pecuniary arrangement, still in force, with the Hammond Synges,
who really, though they never took her out&mdash;practically she went
out alone&mdash;had their hands half the time in her pocket.&nbsp; She
had to pay for everything, down to her share of the wine-bills and the
horses&rsquo; fodder, down to Bertie Hammond Synge&rsquo;s fare in the
&ldquo;underground&rdquo; when he went to the City for her.&nbsp; She
had been left with just money enough to turn her head; and it hadn&rsquo;t
even been put in trust, nothing prudent or proper had been done with
it.&nbsp; She could spend her capital, and at the rate she was going,
expensive, extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help, it certainly
wouldn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> perhaps take her, independent, unencumbered
as you are?&rdquo; I asked of Mrs. Meldrum.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
probably, with one exception, the sanest person she knows, and you at
least wouldn&rsquo;t scandalously fleece her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what I wouldn&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; my humorous
friend demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve thought how I can
help her&mdash;it has kept me awake at night.&nbsp; But doing it&rsquo;s
impossible; she&rsquo;ll take nothing from me.&nbsp; You know what she
does&mdash;she hugs me and runs away.&nbsp; She has an instinct about
me and feels that I&rsquo;ve one about her.&nbsp; And then she dislikes
me for another reason that I&rsquo;m not quite clear about, but that
I&rsquo;m well aware of and that I shall find out some day.&nbsp; So
far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here;
she wants naturally enough a much wider field.&nbsp; She must live in
London&mdash;her game is there.&nbsp; So she takes the line of adoring
me, of saying she can never forget that I was devoted to her mother&mdash;which
I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world have been&mdash;and of giving me a wide
berth.&nbsp; I think she positively dislikes to look at me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all right; there&rsquo;s no obligation; though people in general can&rsquo;t
take their eyes off me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that at this moment,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what does it matter where or how, for the present, she lives?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll marry infallibly, marry early, and everything then will
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom will she marry?&rdquo; my companion gloomily asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one she likes.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so abnormally pretty
that she can do anything.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll fascinate some nabob or
some prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards.&nbsp;
Moreover she&rsquo;s not so pretty as you make her out; she hasn&rsquo;t
a scrap of a figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, but one doesn&rsquo;t in the least miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meldrum, &ldquo;but one will when
she&rsquo;s older and when everything will have to count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she&rsquo;s older she&rsquo;ll count as a princess, so
it won&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has other drawbacks,&rdquo; my companion went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like
sugar-balls&mdash;which they greatly resemble&mdash;in a child&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t use them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use them?&nbsp; Why, she does nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make fools of young men, but not to read or write, not
to do any sort of work.&nbsp; She never opens a book, and her maid writes
her notes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say that those who live in glass houses
shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones.&nbsp; Of course I know that if I didn&rsquo;t
wear my goggles I shouldn&rsquo;t be good for much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Miss Saunt ought to sport such things?&rdquo;
I exclaimed with more horror than I meant to show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t prescribe for her; I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re
what she requires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her eyes?&rdquo; I asked after
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know; but I heard from her mother years
ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles
and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust, she
would always have to be extremely careful.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I hope
she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I echoed the hope, but I remember well the impression this made upon
me&mdash;my immediate pang of resentment, a disgust almost equal to
Flora&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; I felt as if a great rare sapphire had split
in my hand.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>This conversation occurred the night before I went back to town.&nbsp;
I settled on the morrow to take a late train, so that I had still my
morning to spend at Folkestone, where during the greater part of it
I was out with my mother.&nbsp; Every one in the place was as usual
out with some one else, and even had I been free to go and take leave
of her I should have been sure that Flora Saunt would not be at home.&nbsp;
Just where she was I presently discovered: she was at the far end of
the cliff, the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of Sandgate
and Hythe.&nbsp; Her back, however, was turned to this attraction; it
rested with the aid of her elbows, thrust slightly behind her so that
her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears, on the high
rail that inclosed the down.&nbsp; Two gentlemen stood before her whose
faces we couldn&rsquo;t see but who even as observed from the rear were
visibly absorbed in the charming figure-piece submitted to them.&nbsp;
I was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little
person, with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape, with
her eternal idleness, her eternal happiness, her absence of moods and
mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet, which especially
now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility
so much of the foreground&mdash;I was reminded anew, I say, how our
young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn&rsquo;t
explain and that the mention of her lapses didn&rsquo;t affect.&nbsp;
Where she was amiss nothing counted, and where she was right everything
did.&nbsp; I say she was wanting in mystery, but that after all was
her secret.&nbsp; This happened to be my first chance of introducing
her to my mother, who had not much left in life but the quiet look from
under the hood of her chair at the things which, when she should have
quitted those she loved, she could still trust to make the world good
for them.&nbsp; I wondered an instant how much she might be moved to
trust Flora Saunt, and then while the chair stood still and she waited
I went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her.&nbsp; In this
way I saw that if one of Flora&rsquo;s attendants was the inevitable
young Hammond Synge, master of ceremonies of her regular court, always
offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar, the other
was a personage I had not yet encountered, a small pale youth in showy
knickerbockers, whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose
little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained.&nbsp;
I remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of
a pretender: I scarce know why unless because of the motive I felt in
the stare he fixed on me when I asked Miss Saunt to come away.&nbsp;
He struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence;
but it didn&rsquo;t matter, for Flora came away with alacrity, bringing
all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle
of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments,
as a painter could take heed, strike one always as the same obscure
elegance.&nbsp; She seated herself on the floor of my mother&rsquo;s
chair, a little too much on her right instep as I afterwards gathered,
caressing her still hand, smiling up into her cold face, commending
and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt.&nbsp; She told
her immediately, as if it were something for her to hold on by, that
she was soon to sit to me for a &ldquo;likeness,&rdquo; and these words
gave me a chance to enquire if it would be the fate of the picture,
should I finish it, to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers.&nbsp;
Her lips, at this, parted in a stare; her eyes darkened to the purple
of one of the shadow-patches on the sea.&nbsp; She showed for the passing
instant the face of some splendid tragic mask, and I remembered for
the inconsequence of it what Mrs. Meldrum had said about her sight.&nbsp;
I had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her, but
that didn&rsquo;t seem exactly kind; so I substituted another question,
inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh a gentleman I met at Boulogne.&nbsp; He has come over to
see me.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a moment she added: &ldquo;Lord Iffield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never heard of Lord Iffield, but her mention of his having
been at Boulogne helped me to give him a niche.&nbsp; Mrs. Meldrum had
incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of Mrs. Floyd-Taylor,
Flora&rsquo;s recent hostess in that charming town, a lady who, it appeared,
had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for
their leisure.&nbsp; She had always one or other in hand and had apparently
on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite
coast.&nbsp; I had a vague idea that Boulogne was not a resort of the
world&rsquo;s envied; at the same time there might very well have been
a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune.&nbsp;
I could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should
be drawn to Folkestone by Flora Saunt.&nbsp; But it was not in truth
of these things I was thinking; what was uppermost in my mind was a
matter which, though it had no sort of keeping, insisted just then on
coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Miss Saunt,&rdquo; I suddenly demanded, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;re so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful
eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was startled by the effect of my words; the girl threw back her
head, changing colour from brow to chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;True?&nbsp; Who
in the world says so?&rdquo;&nbsp; I repented of my question in a flash;
the way she met it made it seem cruel, and I felt my mother look at
me in some surprise.&nbsp; I took care, in answer to Flora&rsquo;s challenge,
not to incriminate Mrs. Meldrum.&nbsp; I answered that the rumour had
reached me only in the vaguest form and that if I had been moved to
put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible.&nbsp;
Her blush died away, but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in
its track.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you ever hear such a thing said again you
can say it&rsquo;s a horrid lie!&rdquo;&nbsp; I had brought on a commotion
deeper than any I was prepared for; but it was explained in some degree
by the next words she uttered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say there&rsquo;s
nothing the matter with any part of me whatever, not the least little
thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke with her habitual complacency, with triumphant
assurance; she smiled again, and I could see how she wished that she
hadn&rsquo;t so taken me up.&nbsp; She turned it off with a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve good eyes, good teeth, a good digestion and a good
temper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sound of wind and limb!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears, nothing
less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular.&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t submit to the imputation of a flaw.&nbsp; I expressed
my delight in what she told me, assuring her I should always do battle
for her; and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place
on my mother&rsquo;s toes.&nbsp; The young men presented their backs
to us; they were leaning on the rail of the cliff.&nbsp; Our incident
had produced a certain awkwardness, and while I was thinking of what
next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be Lord Considine.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that moment the youth
marked for this high destiny turned round, and she spoke to my mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll introduce him to you&mdash;he&rsquo;s awfully nice.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She beckoned and invited him with her parasol; the movement struck me
as taking everything for granted.&nbsp; I had heard of Lord Considine
and if I had not been able to place Lord Iffield it was because I didn&rsquo;t
know the name of his eldest son.&nbsp; The young man took no notice
of Miss Saunt&rsquo;s appeal; he only stared a moment and then on her
repeating it quietly turned his back.&nbsp; She was an odd creature:
she didn&rsquo;t blush at this; she only said to my mother apologetically,
but with the frankest sweetest amusement, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind,
do you?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a monster of shyness!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was as
if she were sorry for every one&mdash;for Lord Iffield, the victim of
a complaint so painful, and for my mother, the subject of a certain
slight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want him!&rdquo; said
my mother, but Flora added some promise of how she would handle him
for his rudeness.&nbsp; She would clearly never explain anything by
any failure of her own appeal.&nbsp; There rolled over me while she
took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious
dread.&nbsp; I seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate, and yet
what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and
such joy?&nbsp; I had a dim idea that Lord Considine was a great proprietor,
and though there mingled with it a faint impression that I shouldn&rsquo;t
like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that
the girl mightn&rsquo;t miss her possible fortune.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>One day in the course of the following June there was ushered into
my studio a gentleman whom I had not yet seen but with whom I had been
very briefly in correspondence.&nbsp; A letter from him had expressed
to me some days before his regret on learning that my &ldquo;splendid
portrait&rdquo; of Miss Flora Louisa Saunt, whose full name figured
by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the Academy, had
found a purchaser before the close of the private view.&nbsp; He took
the liberty of inquiring whether I might have at his service some other
memorial of the same lovely head, some preliminary sketch, some study
for the picture.&nbsp; I had replied that I had indeed painted Miss
Saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work I should
be happy to show him what I had done.&nbsp; Mr. Geoffrey Dawling, the
person thus introduced to me, stumbled into my room with awkward movements
and equivocal sounds&mdash;a long, lean, confused, confusing young man,
with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth.&nbsp; He bore in its
most indelible pressure the postmark, as it were, of Oxford, and as
soon as he opened his mouth I perceived, in addition to a remarkable
revelation of gums, that the text of the queer communication matched
the registered envelope.&nbsp; He was full of refinements and angles,
of dreary and distinguished knowledge.&nbsp; Of his unconscious drollery
his dress freely partook; it seemed, from the gold ring into which his
red necktie was passed to the square toe-caps of his boots, to conform
with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last.&nbsp;
There were moments when his overdone urbanity, all suggestive stammers
and interrogative quavers, made him scarcely intelligible; but I felt
him to be a gentleman and I liked the honesty of his errand and the
expression of his good green eyes.</p>
<p>As a worshipper at the shrine of beauty, however, he needed explaining,
especially when I found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model;
had on the mere evidence of my picture taken, as he said, a tremendous
fancy to her looks.&nbsp; I ought doubtless to have been humiliated
by the simplicity of his judgment of them, a judgment for which the
rendering was lost in the subject, quite leaving out the element of
art.&nbsp; He was like the innocent reader for whom the story is &ldquo;really
true&rdquo; and the author a negligible quantity.&nbsp; He had come
to me only because he wanted to purchase, and I remember being so amused
at his attitude, which I had never seen equally marked in a person of
education, that I asked him why, for the sort of enjoyment he desired,
it wouldn&rsquo;t be more to the point to deal directly with the lady.&nbsp;
He stared and blushed at this; the idea clearly alarmed him.&nbsp; He
was an extraordinary case&mdash;personally so modest that I could see
it had never occurred to him.&nbsp; He had fallen in love with a painted
sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for.&nbsp; He
was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart
to the miniature of the princess beyond seas.&nbsp; Until I knew him
better this puzzled me much&mdash;the link was so missing between his
sensibility and his type.&nbsp; He was of course bewildered by my sketches,
which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality; but
for one of them, a comparative failure, he ended by conceiving a preference
so arbitrary and so lively that, taking no second look at the others,
he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion
over the question of price.&nbsp; I helped him over that stile, and
he went off without having asked me a direct question about Miss Saunt,
yet with his acquisition under his arm.&nbsp; His delicacy was such
that he evidently considered his rights to be limited; he had acquired
none at all in regard to the original of the picture.&nbsp; There were
others&mdash;for I was curious about him&mdash;that I wanted him to
feel I conceded: I should have been glad of his carrying away a sense
of ground acquired for coming back.&nbsp; To ensure this I had probably
only to invite him, and I perfectly recall the impulse that made me
forbear.&nbsp; It operated suddenly from within while he hung about
the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle
grin.&nbsp; If he was smitten with Flora&rsquo;s ghost what mightn&rsquo;t
be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow?&nbsp;
This source of radiance, flooding my poor place, might very well happen
to be present the next time he should turn up.&nbsp; The idea was sharp
within me that there were relations and complications it was no mission
of mine to bring about.&nbsp; If they were to develop they should develop
in their very own sense.</p>
<p>Let me say at once that they did develop and that I perhaps after
all had something to do with it.&nbsp; If Mr. Dawling had departed without
a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection
no less powerful than that of our young lady herself.&nbsp; I had seen
her repeatedly for months: she had grown to regard my studio as the
temple of her beauty.&nbsp; This miracle was recorded and celebrated
there as nowhere else; in other places there was occasional reference
to other subjects of remark.&nbsp; The degree of her presumption continued
to be stupefying; there was nothing so extraordinary save the degree
in which she never paid for it.&nbsp; She was kept innocent, that is
she was kept safe, by her egotism, but she was helped also, though she
had now put off her mourning, by the attitude of the lone orphan who
had to be a law unto herself.&nbsp; It was as a lone orphan that she
came and went, as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush.&nbsp;
The neglect of the Hammond Synges gave relief to this character, and
she made it worth their while to be, as every one said, too shocking.&nbsp;
Lord Iffield had gone to India to shoot tigers, but he returned in time
for the punctual private view: it was he who had snapped up, as Flora
called it, the gem of the exhibition.&nbsp; My hope for the girl&rsquo;s
future had slipped ignominiously off his back, but after his purchase
of the portrait I tried to cultivate a new faith.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s
own faith was wonderful.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t however be contagious:
too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values.&nbsp;
Her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night.&nbsp; How indeed
could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging?&nbsp;
She was after all vulgar enough, and by the time I had mastered her
profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line I
was decidedly tired of its &ldquo;purity,&rdquo; which affected me at
last as inane.&nbsp; One moved with her, moreover, among phenomena mismated
and unrelated; nothing in her talk ever matched anything out of it.&nbsp;
Lord Iffield was dying of love for her, but his family was leading him
a life.&nbsp; His mother, horrid woman, had told some one that she would
rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely
one of themselves.&nbsp; He had given his young friend unmistakable
signs, but was lying low, gaining time: it was in his father&rsquo;s
power to be, both in personal and in pecuniary ways, excessively nasty
to him.&nbsp; His father wouldn&rsquo;t last for ever&mdash;quite the
contrary; and he knew how thoroughly, in spite of her youth, her beauty
and the swarm of her admirers, some of them positively threatening in
their passion, he could trust her to hold out.&nbsp; There were richer,
cleverer men, there were greater personages too, but she liked her &ldquo;little
viscount&rdquo; just as he was, and liked to think that, bullied and
persecuted, he had her there so gratefully to rest upon.&nbsp; She came
back to me with tale upon tale, and it all might be or mightn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I never met my pretty model in the world&mdash;she moved, it appeared,
in exalted circles&mdash;and could only admire, in her wealth of illustration,
the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand.</p>
<p>I had on the first opportunity spoken to her of Geoffrey Dawling,
and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience,
asking me indeed more questions about him than I could answer; then
she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking, the disclosure
of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters: on people who
had followed her into railway carriages; guards and porters even who
had literally stuck there; others who had spoken to her in shops and
hung about her house door; cabmen, upon her honour, in London, who,
to gaze their fill at her, had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction
through the very glasses of four-wheelers.&nbsp; She lost herself in
these reminiscences, the moral of which was that poor Mr. Dawling was
only one of a million.&nbsp; When therefore the next autumn she flourished
into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was
to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasn&rsquo;t
because she had run after him.&nbsp; Dawling explained with a hundred
grins that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended
by doing so&mdash;a proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our
young lady to asseverate that she hadn&rsquo;t in the least wished to
get Mr. Dawling.&nbsp; She mightn&rsquo;t have wished to get him, but
she wished to show him, and I seemed to read that if she could treat
him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb.&nbsp; True there
always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps.&nbsp; Much
at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in July.&nbsp;
She had spent four months abroad, where, on Swiss and Italian lakes,
in German cities, in the French capital, many accidents might have happened.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>I had been again with my mother, but except Mrs. Meldrum and the
gleam of France had not found at Folkestone my old resources and pastimes.&nbsp;
Mrs. Meldrum, much edified by my report of the performances, as she
called them, in my studio, had told me that to her knowledge Flora would
soon be on the straw: she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices
that there was almost nothing more left to swallow.&nbsp; Perched on
her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal
light: she knew so much more about everything and everybody than I could
ever squeeze out of my colour-tubes.&nbsp; She knew that Flora was acting
on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with: her precious
reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it,
that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should
be really pinched.&nbsp; She had a sum put by for a liberal outfit;
meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches
to the altar, keep her afloat in the society in which she would most
naturally meet her match.&nbsp; Lord Iffield had been seen with her
at Lucerne, at Cadenabbia; but it was Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s conviction
that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation.&nbsp;
The girl had a certain hold of him, but with a great deal of swagger
he hadn&rsquo;t the spirit of a sheep: he was in fear of his father
and would never commit himself in Lord Considine&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp;
The most Flora might achieve was that he wouldn&rsquo;t marry some one
else.&nbsp; Geoffrey Dawling, to Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s knowledge (I had
told her of the young man&rsquo;s visit) had attached himself on the
way back from Italy to the Hammond Synge group.&nbsp; My informant was
in a position to be definite about this dangler; she knew about his
people; she had heard of him before.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t he been a friend
of one of her nephews at Oxford?&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t he spent the Christmas
holidays precisely three years before at her brother-in-law&rsquo;s
in Yorkshire, taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision
by wilful Betty, the second daughter of the house?&nbsp; Her sister,
who liked the floundering youth, had written to her to complain of Betty,
and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of Flora&rsquo;s
was one of those oft-cited proofs that the world is small and that there
are not enough people to go round.&nbsp; His father had been something
or other in the Treasury; his grandfather on the mother&rsquo;s side
had been something or other in the Church.&nbsp; He had come into the
paternal estate, two or three thousand a year in Hampshire; but he had
let the place advantageously and was generous to four plain sisters
who lived at Bournemouth and adored him.&nbsp; The family was hideous
all round, but the very salt of the earth.&nbsp; He was supposed to
be unspeakably clever; he was fond of London, fond of books, of intellectual
society and of the idea of a political career.&nbsp; That such a man
should be at the same time fond of Flora Saunt attested, as the phrase
in the first volume of Gibbon has it, the variety of his inclinations.&nbsp;
I was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other
things together.&nbsp; Betty, one of five and with views above her station,
was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity.&nbsp;
Of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look
at her again.&nbsp; It would be eminently desirable that Flora should
learn the lesson of Betty&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>I was not struck, I confess, with all this in my mind, by any symptom
on our young lady&rsquo;s part of that sort of meditation.&nbsp; The
one moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect, which
Mr. Dawling, smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by
the doom-dealing gods, had followed from London to Venice and from Venice
back to London again.&nbsp; I afterwards learned that her version of
this episode was profusely inexact: his personal acquaintance with her
had been determined by an accident remarkable enough, I admit, in connexion
with what had gone before&mdash;a coincidence at all events superficially
striking.&nbsp; At Munich, returning from a tour in the Tyrol with two
of his sisters, he had found himself at the table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te
of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the
mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire.&nbsp; He had been tossed
by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board;
but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet
of his apparition.&nbsp; On the following, with an equal incoherence,
a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters, whom he left behind, he
made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he had
already felt the cold breath.&nbsp; That fate, in London, very little
later, drove him straight before it&mdash;drove him one Sunday afternoon,
in the rain, to the door of the Hammond Synges.&nbsp; He marched in
other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces.&nbsp;
But three weeks, when he reappeared to me, had elapsed since then, yet
(to vary my metaphor) the burden he was to carry for the rest of his
days was firmly lashed to his back.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean by this
that Flora had been persuaded to contract her scope; I mean that he
had been treated to the unconditional snub which, as the event was to
show, couldn&rsquo;t have been bettered as a means of securing him.&nbsp;
She hadn&rsquo;t calculated, but she had said &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; and
that word had made a bed big enough for his long-legged patience.&nbsp;
He became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the
piece.</p>
<p>Now that he had acted without my aid I was free to show him this,
and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked
at my door.&nbsp; What he brought with him on these occasions was a
simplicity so huge that, as I turn my ear to the past, I seem even now
to hear it bumping up and down my stairs.&nbsp; That was really what
I saw of him in the light of his behaviour.&nbsp; He had fallen in love
as he might have broken his leg, and the fracture was of a sort that
would make him permanently lame.&nbsp; It was the whole man who limped
and lurched, with nothing of him left in the same position as before.&nbsp;
The tremendous cleverness, the literary society, the political ambition,
the Bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a
little nearer to the floor.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t had an Oxford training
and I had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor Dawling
had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive
sniffs; but I remember asking myself how effectively this privilege
had supposed itself to prepare him for the career on which my friend
appeared now to have embarked.&nbsp; I remember too making up my mind
about the cleverness, which had its uses and I suppose in impenetrable
shades even its critics, but from which the friction of mere personal
intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark.&nbsp;
He accepted without a question both his fever and his chill, and the
only thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of my friendship.&nbsp;
He doubtless told me his simple story, but the matter comes back in
a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece, of my having had
to put it together for him.&nbsp; He took it from me in this form without
a groan, and I gave it him quite as it came; he took it again and again,
spending his odd half-hours with me as if for the very purpose of learning
how idiotically he was in love.&nbsp; He told me I made him see things:
to begin with, hadn&rsquo;t I first made him see Flora Saunt?&nbsp;
I wanted him to give her up and lucidly informed him why; on which he
never protested nor contradicted, never was even so alembicated as to
declare just for the sake of the point that he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
He simply and pointlessly didn&rsquo;t, and when at the end of three
months I asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his
nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want
to help her was just the deficiencies I dwelt on.&nbsp; I could only
reply without gross developments: &ldquo;Oh if you&rsquo;re as sorry
for her as that!&rdquo;&nbsp; I too was nearly as sorry for her as that,
but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion.&nbsp;
With Dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any
visible motive; so that when eventually the motive was supplied each
could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his
foresight.</p>
<p>After he had begun to haunt my studio Miss Saunt quite gave it up,
and I finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to
put pressure on her to marry him.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know I would
take it that way, else she would never have brought him to see me.&nbsp;
It was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness
I asked him at last to sit to me.&nbsp; I dare say moreover she was
disgusted to hear that I had ended by attempting almost as many sketches
of his beauty as I had attempted of hers.&nbsp; What was the value of
tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself?&nbsp; My relation
to poor Dawling&rsquo;s want of modelling was simple enough.&nbsp; I
was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his
soul.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>It befell at this period, just before Christmas, that on my having
gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or
two, my eyes fleeing from superfluity, lighted at a distance on the
bright concretion of Flora Saunt, an exhibitability that held its own
even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls.&nbsp;
A huge quarter of the place, the biggest bazaar &ldquo;on earth,&rdquo;
was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies, as well as
with purchasers and vendors haggard alike, in the blaze of the gas,
with hesitations.&nbsp; I was just about to appeal to Flora to avert
that stage of my errand when I saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman
whose identity, though more than a year had elapsed, came back to me
from the Folkestone cliff.&nbsp; It had been associated on that scene
with showy knickerbockers; at present it overflowed more splendidly
into a fur-trimmed overcoat.&nbsp; Lord Iffield&rsquo;s presence made
me waver an instant before crossing over, and during that instant Flora,
blank and undistinguishing, as if she too were after all weary of alternatives,
looked straight across at me.&nbsp; I was on the point of raising my
hat to her when I observed that her face gave no sign.&nbsp; I was exactly
in the line of her vision, but she either didn&rsquo;t see me or didn&rsquo;t
recognise me, or else had a reason to pretend she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Was her reason that I had displeased her and that she wished to punish
me?&nbsp; I had always thought it one of her merits that she wasn&rsquo;t
vindictive.&nbsp; She at any rate simply looked away; and at this moment
one of the shop-girls, who had apparently gone off in search of it,
bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy.&nbsp; It so happened
that I followed closely what then took place, afterwards recognising
that I had been led to do so, led even through the crowd to press nearer
for the purpose, by an impression of which in the act I was not fully
conscious.</p>
<p>Flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion; then
seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved
away with the shop-girl, who had evidently offered to conduct her into
the presence of more objects of the same sort.&nbsp; When she reached
the indicated spot I was in a position still to observe her.&nbsp; She
had asked some question about the working of the toy, and the girl,
taking it herself, began to explain the little secret.&nbsp; Flora bent
her head over it, but she clearly didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; I saw
her, in a manner that quickened my curiosity, give a glance back at
the place from which she had come.&nbsp; Lord Iffield was talking with
another young person; she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a
question addressed to her own attendant.&nbsp; She then drew closer
to the table near which she stood and, turning her back to me, bent
her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over
the small object the girl had attempted to explain.&nbsp; She took it
again and, after a moment, with her face well averted, made an odd motion
of her arms and a significant little duck of her head.&nbsp; These slight
signs, singular as it may appear, produced in my bosom an agitation
so great that I failed to notice Lord Iffield&rsquo;s whereabouts.&nbsp;
He had rejoined her; he was close upon her before I knew it or before
she knew it herself.&nbsp; I felt at that instant the strangest of all
promptings: if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused
me to dash between them in some such manner as to give Flora a caution.&nbsp;
In fact as it was I think I could have done this in time had I not been
checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse.&nbsp; There were
three seconds during which I saw the young man and yet let him come
on.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I make the quick calculation that if he didn&rsquo;t
catch what Flora was doing I too might perhaps not catch it?&nbsp; She
at any rate herself took the alarm.&nbsp; On perceiving her companion&rsquo;s
nearness she made, still averted, another duck of her head and a shuffle
of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been
holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness
that I hear at this hour.&nbsp; Lord Iffield had already seized her
arm; with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him.&nbsp; Then
it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight: this exquisite
creature, blushing, glaring, exposed, with a pair of big black-rimmed
eye-glasses, defacing her by their position, crookedly astride of her
beautiful nose.&nbsp; She made a grab at them with her free hand while
I turned confusedly away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how soon it was I spoke to Geoffrey Dawling;
his sittings were irregular, but it was certainly the very next time
he gave me one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any rumour ever reached you of Miss Saunt&rsquo;s having
anything the matter with her eyes?&rdquo;&nbsp; He stared with a candour
that was a sufficient answer to my question, backing it up with a shocked
and mystified &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I asked him if he had
observed in her any symptom, however disguised, of embarrassed sight;
on which, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, he exclaimed &ldquo;Disguised?&rdquo;
as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
not a bit myopic,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t blink or
contract her lids.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fully recognised this and I mentioned
that she altogether denied the impeachment; owing it to him moreover
to explain the ground of my inquiry, I gave him a sketch of the incident
that had taken place before me at the shop.&nbsp; He knew all about
Lord Iffield; that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as
his preferred, his injurious rival.&nbsp; Poor Dawling&rsquo;s contention
was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship
and the young lady, the sort of thing that was announced in the Morning
Post, renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him;
but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled
to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not
cruelly locked.&nbsp; He was naturally much struck with my anecdote
and still more with my interpretation of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something, there <i>is</i> something&mdash;possibly
something very grave, certainly something that requires she should make
use of artificial aids.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t admit it publicly, because
with her idolatry of her beauty, the feeling she is all made up of,
she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement.&nbsp;
She has used them in secret, but that is evidently not enough, for the
affection she suffers from, apparently some definite menace, has lately
grown much worse.&nbsp; She looked straight at me in the shop, which
was violently lighted, without seeing it was I.&nbsp; At the same distance,
at Folkestone, where as you know I first met her, where I heard this
mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing, she appeared
easily enough to recognise people.&nbsp; At present she couldn&rsquo;t
really make out anything the shop-girl showed her.&nbsp; She has successfully
concealed from the man I saw her with that she resorts in private to
a pince-nez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders
from her oculist, but because literally the poor thing can&rsquo;t accomplish
without such help half the business of life.&nbsp; Iffield however has
suspected something, and his suspicions, whether expressed or kept to
himself, have put him on the watch.&nbsp; I happened to have a glimpse
of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had thought it all out; my idea explained many things, and Dawling
turned pale as he listened to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he rough with her?&rdquo; he anxiously asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell what passed between them?&nbsp; I fled from
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My companion stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to say her eyesight&rsquo;s
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&nbsp; In that case how could she take life
as she does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>does</i> she take life?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the question!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He sat there bewilderedly brooding; the tears rose to his lids; they
reminded me of those I had seen in Flora&rsquo;s the day I risked my
enquiry.&nbsp; The question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction
I was ready to answer, but I hesitated to let him hear as yet all that
my reflections had suggested.&nbsp; I was indeed privately astonished
at their ingenuity.&nbsp; For the present I only rejoined that it struck
me she was playing a particular game; at which he went on as if he hadn&rsquo;t
heard me, suddenly haunted with a fear, lost in the dark possibility.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean there&rsquo;s a danger of anything very bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you must ask her special adviser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in the world is her special adviser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a conception.&nbsp; But we mustn&rsquo;t get
too excited.&nbsp; My impression would be that she has only to observe
a few ordinary rules, to exercise a little common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dawling jumped at this.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see&mdash;to stick to the
pince-nez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To follow to the letter her oculist&rsquo;s prescription,
whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not a thing to be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour it <i>shan&rsquo;t</i> be!&rdquo; he roundly
declared; and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had
quite settled the business.&nbsp; After a considerable interval, while
I botched away, he suddenly said: &ldquo;Did they make a great difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those things she had put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the glasses&mdash;in her beauty?&nbsp; She looked queer
of course, but it was partly because one was unaccustomed.&nbsp; There
are women who look charming in nippers.&nbsp; What, at any rate, if
she does look queer?&nbsp; She must be mad not to accept that alternative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> mad,&rdquo; said Geoffrey Dawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad to refuse you, I grant.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;the pince-nez, which was a large and peculiar one, was all awry:
she had half pulled it off, but it continued to stick, and she was crimson,
she was angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been horrible!&rdquo; my companion groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> horrible.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s still more horrible
to defy all warnings; it&rsquo;s still more horrible to be landed in&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Without saying in what I disgustedly shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>After a glance at me Dawling jerked round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you
do believe that she may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The thing would be to make <i>her</i> believe
it.&nbsp; She only needs a good scare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does
take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh who knows?&rdquo; I rejoined with small sincerity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Iffield is absolutely a brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would take her with leather blinders, like a shying mare!&rdquo;
cried Geoffrey Dawling.</p>
<p>I had an impression that Iffield wouldn&rsquo;t, but I didn&rsquo;t
communicate it, for I wanted to pacify my friend, whom I had discomposed
too much for the purposes of my sitting.&nbsp; I recollect that I did
some good work that morning, but it also comes back to me that before
we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote, connecting
itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious
and unregistered, had covered with light the subject of our colloquy.&nbsp;
He had had a formless perception of some secret that drove Miss Saunt
to subterfuges, and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this
secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didn&rsquo;t
and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw.&nbsp;
When one pieced things together it was astonishing what ground they
covered.&nbsp; Just as he was going away he asked me from what source
at Folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded.&nbsp; When I had given
him, as I saw no reason not to do, the name of Mrs. Meldrum he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Oh I know all about her; she&rsquo;s a friend of some friends
of mine!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this I remembered wilful Betty and said to
myself that I knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>A few days later I again heard Dawling on my stairs, and even before
he passed my threshold I knew he had something to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down to Folkestone&mdash;it was necessary
I should see her!&rdquo;&nbsp; I forget whether he had come straight
from the station; he was at any rate out of breath with his news, which
it took me however a minute to apply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you&rsquo;ve been with Mrs. Meldrum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it.&nbsp;
It worked upon me awfully&mdash;I mean what you told me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was, and it showed
me sufficiently that he had not been reassured.&nbsp; I laid, to comfort
him and smiling at a venture, a friendly hand on his arm, and he dropped
into my eyes, fixing them an instant, a strange distended look which
might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I <i>know</i>&mdash;now!&rdquo; he said with an emphasis he rarely
used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then did Mrs. Meldrum tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing that signified, for she has no real knowledge.&nbsp;
But that one thing was everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that she can&rsquo;t bear the sight of her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His pronouns required some arranging, but after I had successfully dealt
with them I replied that I was quite aware of Miss Saunt&rsquo;s trick
of turning her back on the good lady of Folkestone.&nbsp; Only what
did that prove?&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you never guessed?&nbsp; I guessed
as soon as she spoke!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dawling towered over me in dismal
triumph.&nbsp; It was the first time in our acquaintance that, on any
ground of understanding this had occurred; but even so remarkable an
incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue:
&ldquo;Why, the effect of those spectacles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seemed to catch the tail of his idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear
woman&rsquo;s ugliness.&rdquo;&nbsp; This remark began to flash a light,
and when he quickly added &ldquo;She sees herself, she sees her own
fate!&rdquo; my response was so immediate that I had almost taken the
words out of his mouth.&nbsp; While I tried to fix this sudden image
of Flora&rsquo;s face glazed in and cross-barred even as Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s
was glazed and barred, he went on to assert that only the horror of
that image, looming out at herself, could be the reason of her avoiding
the person who so forced it home.&nbsp; The fact he had encountered
made everything hideously vivid, and more vivid than anything else that
just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed
to Flora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see,&rdquo; I presently returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
would become of Lord Iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them?&nbsp;
What indeed would become of every one, what would become of everything?&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was an enquiry that Dawling was evidently unprepared to meet, and
I completed it by saying at last: &ldquo;My dear fellow, for that matter,
what would become of <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he turned on me his good green eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful, and I
discovered at this moment how much I really liked him.&nbsp; None the
less, at the same time, perversely and rudely, I felt the droll side
of our discussion of such alternatives.&nbsp; It made me laugh out and
say to him while I laughed: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d take her even with those
things of Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained mournfully grave; I could see that he was surprised at
my rude mirth.&nbsp; But he summoned back a vision of the lady at Folkestone
and conscientiously replied: &ldquo;Even with those things of Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I begged him not to resent my laughter, which but exposed the fact that
we had built a monstrous castle in the air.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he see
on what flimsy ground the structure rested?&nbsp; The evidence was preposterously
small.&nbsp; He believed the worst, but we were really uninformed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find out the truth,&rdquo; he promptly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you?&nbsp; If you question her you&rsquo;ll simply
drive her to perjure herself.&nbsp; Wherein after all does it concern
you to know the truth?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s own affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you tell me your story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a trifle embarrassed.&nbsp; &ldquo;To warn you off,&rdquo;
I smiled.&nbsp; He took no more notice of these words than presently
to remark that Lord Iffield had no serious intentions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
possibly,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t speak as
if Lord Iffield and you were her only alternatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dawling thought a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t something be
got out of the people she has consulted?&nbsp; She must have been to
people.&nbsp; How else can she have been condemned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condemned to what?&nbsp; Condemned to perpetual nippers?&nbsp;
Of course she has consulted some of the big specialists, but she has
done it, you may be sure, in the most clandestine manner; and even if
it were supposable that they would tell you anything&mdash;which I altogether
doubt&mdash;you would have great difficulty in finding out which men
they are.&nbsp; Therefore leave it alone; never show her what you suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right, I promise&rdquo;&mdash;but he was gloomy enough.&nbsp; He was
a lover facing the fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved
one was ready to practise: it made so remarkably little difference.&nbsp;
I could see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from this moment
overlook the girl&rsquo;s fatuity and folly.&nbsp; She was always accessible
to him&mdash;that I knew; for if she had told him he was an idiot to
dream she could dream of him, she would have rebuked the imputation
of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard
him as a friend.&nbsp; What were most of her friends&mdash;what were
all of them&mdash;but repudiated idiots?&nbsp; I was perfectly aware
that in her conversations and confidences I myself for instance had
a niche in the gallery.&nbsp; As regards poor Dawling I knew how often
he still called on the Hammond Synges.&nbsp; It was not there but under
the wing of the Floyd-Taylors that her intimacy with Lord Iffield most
flourished.&nbsp; At all events, when a week after the visit I have
just summarised Flora&rsquo;s name was one morning brought up to me,
I jumped at the conclusion that Dawling had been with her, and even
I fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>She left me, after she had been introduced, in no suspense about
her present motive; she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten
me; but I promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably
panted our young man was not accountable.&nbsp; She had but one thought
in the world, and that thought was for Lord Iffield.&nbsp; I had the
strangest saddest scene with her, and if it did me no other good it
at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously, from
the first, she had struck me as a creature of tragedy.&nbsp; In showing
me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know how much she meant to tell me when she came&mdash;I
think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation; at any rate
she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down
and sob, to be wretched and true.&nbsp; When she had once begun to let
herself go the movement took her off her feet; the relief of it was
like the cessation of a cramp.&nbsp; She shared in a word her long secret,
she shifted her sharp pain.&nbsp; She brought, I confess, tears to my
own eyes, tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty.&nbsp;
Her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of
its consequences, the most immediate of which was that I went that afternoon
to see Geoffrey Dawling, who had in those days rooms in Welbeck Street,
where I presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition
that he might have come in.&nbsp; He had not come in, but he was expected,
and I was invited to enter and wait for him: a lady, I was informed,
was already in his sitting-room.&nbsp; I hesitated, a little at a loss:
it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps Flora
Saunt.&nbsp; But when I asked if she were young and remarkably pretty
I received so significant a &ldquo;No sir!&rdquo; that I risked an advance
and after a minute in this manner found myself, to my astonishment,
face to face with Mrs. Meldrum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you dear thing,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
delighted to see you: you spare me another compromising d&eacute;marche!&nbsp;
But for this I should have called on you also.&nbsp; Know the worst
at once: if you see me here it&rsquo;s at least deliberate&mdash;it&rsquo;s
planned, plotted, shameless.&nbsp; I came up on purpose to see him,
upon my word I&rsquo;m in love with him.&nbsp; Why, if you valued my
peace of mind, did you let him the other day at Folkestone dawn upon
my delighted eyes?&nbsp; I found myself there in half an hour simply
infatuated with him.&nbsp; With a perfect sense of everything that can
be urged against him I hold him none the less the very pearl of men.&nbsp;
However, I haven&rsquo;t come up to declare my passion&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
come to bring him news that will interest him much more.&nbsp; Above
all I&rsquo;ve come to urge upon him to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Flora Saunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what he says and does: he must be as still as a mouse!&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s at last really engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a tremendous secret?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was moved
to mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely: she wired me this noon, and spent another shilling
to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had better have spent it to tell you that she had just
passed an hour with the creature you see before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has just passed an hour with every one in the place!&rdquo;
Mrs. Meldrum cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve vital reasons, she says,
for it&rsquo;s not coming out for a month.&nbsp; Then it will be formally
announced, but meanwhile her rejoicing is wild.&nbsp; I daresay Mr.
Dawling already knows and, as it&rsquo;s nearly seven o&rsquo;clock,
may have jumped off London Bridge.&nbsp; But an effect of the talk I
had with him the other day was to make me, on receipt of my telegram,
feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action, so
to call it, on the horrid certitude which I could see he carried away
with him.&nbsp; I had added somehow to that certitude.&nbsp; He told
me what you had told him you had seen in your shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Meldrum, I perceived, had come to Welbeck Street on an errand
identical with my own&mdash;a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity,
inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing
from what Flora&rsquo;s wonderful visit had made of mine.&nbsp; I remarked
to her that what I had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking, but
that I had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
short,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was mystified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor creature is under the darkest of clouds.&nbsp; Oh
she came to triumph, but she remained to talk something in the nature
of sense!&nbsp; She put herself completely in my hands&mdash;she does
me the honour to intimate that of all her friends I&rsquo;m the most
disinterested.&nbsp; After she had announced to me that Lord Iffield
was utterly committed to her and that for the present I was absolutely
the only person in the secret, she arrived at her real business.&nbsp;
She had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at Folkestone when
I asked her for the truth about her eyes.&nbsp; The truth is what you
and I both guessed.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in very bad danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from what cause?&nbsp; I, who by God&rsquo;s mercy have
kept mine, know everything that can be known about eyes,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Meldrum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have kept hers if she had profited by God&rsquo;s
mercy, if she had done in time, done years ago, what was imperatively
ordered her; if she hadn&rsquo;t in fine been cursed with the loveliness
that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable.&nbsp; She may still
keep her sight, or what remains of it, if she&rsquo;ll sacrifice&mdash;and
after all so little&mdash;that purely superficial charm.&nbsp; She must
do as you&rsquo;ve done; she must wear, dear lady, what you wear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon-frame
in August.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven forgive her&mdash;now I understand!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She flushed for dismay.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her
thus seeing, through her great goggles, why it had always been that
Flora held her at such a distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;from what special affection, what state of the eye, her
danger proceeds: that&rsquo;s the one thing she succeeded this morning
in keeping from me.&nbsp; She knows it herself perfectly; she has had
the best advice in Europe.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s
awful, simply awful&rsquo;&mdash;that was the only account she would
give me.&nbsp; Year before last, while she was at Boulogne, she went
for three days with Mrs. Floyd-Taylor to Paris.&nbsp; She there surreptitiously
consulted the greatest man&mdash;even Mrs. Floyd-Taylor doesn&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; Last autumn in Germany she did the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;First
put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle:
then we&rsquo;ll talk&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s practically what they
say.&nbsp; What <i>she</i> says is that she&rsquo;ll put on anything
in nature when she&rsquo;s married, but that she must get married first.&nbsp;
She has always meant to do everything as soon as she&rsquo;s married.&nbsp;
Then and then only she&rsquo;ll be safe.&nbsp; How will any one ever
look at her if she makes herself a fright?&nbsp; How could she ever
have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no use to insist that with her beauty she can never <i>be</i>
a fright.&nbsp; She said to me this morning, poor girl, the most characteristic,
the most harrowing things.&nbsp; &lsquo;My face is all I have&mdash;and
<i>such</i> a face!&nbsp; I knew from the first I could do anything
with it.&nbsp; But I needed it all&mdash;I need it still, every exquisite
inch of it.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t as if I had a figure or anything else.&nbsp;
Oh if God had only given me a figure too, I don&rsquo;t say!&nbsp; Yes,
with a figure, a really good one, like Fanny Floyd-Taylor&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s
hideous, I&rsquo;d have risked plain glasses.&nbsp; Que voulez-vous?&nbsp;
No one is perfect.&rsquo;&nbsp; She says she still has money left, but
I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&nbsp; She has been speculating on
her impunity, on the idea that her danger would hold off: she has literally
been running a race with it.&nbsp; Her theory has been, as you from
the first so clearly saw, that she&rsquo;d get in ahead.&nbsp; She swears
to me that though the &lsquo;bar&rsquo; is too cruel she wears when
she&rsquo;s alone what she has been ordered to wear.&nbsp; But when
the deuce is she alone?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s herself of course that she
has swindled worst: she has put herself off, so insanely that even her
conceit but half accounts for it, with little inadequate concessions,
little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes.&nbsp;
Her great terror is now that Iffield, who already has suspicions, who
has found out her pince-nez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing
hocus-pocus, may discover the dreadful facts; and the essence of what
she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me, to get me
to deny indignantly and authoritatively (for isn&rsquo;t she my &lsquo;favourite
sitter?&rsquo;) that she has anything in life the matter with any part
of her.&nbsp; She sobbed, she &lsquo;went on,&rsquo; she entreated;
after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed
me what she has been through&mdash;showed me also all her terror of
the harm I could do her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait till I&rsquo;m married! wait
till I&rsquo;m married!&rsquo;&nbsp; She took hold of me, she almost
sank on her knees.&nbsp; It seems to me highly immoral, one&rsquo;s
participation in her fraud; but there&rsquo;s no doubt that she must
be married: I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t see behind it!&nbsp;
Therefore,&rdquo; I wound up, &ldquo;Dawling must keep his hands off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Meldrum had held her breath; she gave out a long moan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what I came here to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our host, all unprepared, his
latchkey still in his hand, had just pushed open the door and, startled
at finding us, turned a frightened look from one to the other, wondering
what disaster we were there to announce or avert.</p>
<p>Mrs. Meldrum was on the spot all gaiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to return your sweet visit.&nbsp; Ah,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I
mean to keep up the acquaintance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do,&rdquo; he murmured mechanically and absently,
continuing to look at us.&nbsp; Then he broke out: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
going to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;You already know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He produced an evening paper, which he tossed down on the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Published&mdash;already?&rdquo; I was still more surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Flora can&rsquo;t keep a secret!&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Meldrum
made it light.&nbsp; She went up to poor Dawling and laid a motherly
hand upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;it&rsquo;s just as it ought to
be: don&rsquo;t think about her ever any more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as
he met this adjuration with a stare from which thought, and of the most
defiant and dismal, fairly protruded, the excellent woman put up her
funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>I have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads,
and I confess that as I continue to straighten out my chaplet I am rather
proud of the comparison.&nbsp; The beads are all there, as I said&mdash;they
slip along the string in their small smooth roundness.&nbsp; Geoffrey
Dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed;
in view of which I snatched a moment to nudge him a hint that he might
offer Mrs. Meldrum his hand.&nbsp; He returned me a heavy head-shake,
and I judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as
the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window
of an hospital.&nbsp; Circumstances arising at this time led to my making
an absence from England, and circumstances already existing offered
him a firm basis for similar action.&nbsp; He had after all the usual
resource of a Briton&mdash;he could take to his boats, always drawn
up in our background.&nbsp; He started on a journey round the globe,
and I was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened.&nbsp;
Later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time
during the couple of months after Flora Saunt&rsquo;s brilliant engagement
he had made up, as they say, to the good lady of Folkestone, that good
lady would not have pushed him over the cliff.&nbsp; Strange as she
was to behold I knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer
that shove.&nbsp; I went to New York to paint a couple of portraits;
but I found, once on the spot, that I had counted without Chicago, where
I was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production
of some dozen.&nbsp; I spent a year in America and should probably have
spent a second had I not been summoned back to England by alarming news
from my mother.&nbsp; Her strength had failed, and as soon as I reached
London I hurried down to Folkestone, arriving just at the moment to
offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally.&nbsp; She had been
much worse but was now a little better; and though I found nothing but
satisfaction in having come to her I saw after a few hours that my London
studio, where arrears of work had already met me, would be my place
to await whatever might next occur.&nbsp; Yet before returning to town
I called on Mrs. Meldrum, from whom I had not had a line, and my view
of whom, with the adjacent objects, as I had left them, had been intercepted
by a luxuriant foreground.</p>
<p>Before I had gained her house I met her, as I supposed, coming toward
me across the down, greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle
of her great vitreous badge; and as it was late in the autumn and the
esplanade a blank I was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a
caper on the grass.&nbsp; My enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment,
for I had seen in a few more seconds that the person thus assaulted
had by no means the figure of my military friend.&nbsp; I felt a shock
much greater than any I should have thought possible when on this person&rsquo;s
drawing near I knew her for poor little Flora Saunt.&nbsp; At what moment
she had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which,
it quickly came home to me, one would never linger again: once we were
face to face it so chiefly mattered that I should succeed in looking
entirely unastonished.&nbsp; All I at first saw was the big gold bar
crossing each of her lenses, over which something convex and grotesque,
like the eyes of a large insect, something that now represented her
whole personality, seemed, as out of the orifice of a prison, to strain
forward and press.&nbsp; The face had shrunk away: it looked smaller,
appeared even to look plain; it was at all events, so far as the effect
on a spectator was concerned, wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus
of sight.&nbsp; There was no smile in it, and she made no motion to
take my offered hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea you were down here!&rdquo; I said and I wondered
whether she didn&rsquo;t know me at all or knew me only by my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought I was Mrs. Meldrum,&rdquo; she ever so quietly
answered.</p>
<p>It was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes, you have a tremendous deal in common with Mrs. Meldrum!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve just returned to England after a long absence and I&rsquo;m
on my way to see her.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come with me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
It struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was
well disposed of now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just left her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m staying with her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you
like to paint me now?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; She seemed to speak, with
intense gravity, from behind a mask or a cage.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but treat the question still with high spirits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be a fascinating little artistic problem!&rdquo;&nbsp;
That something was wrong it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to see, but a good
deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if Flora was
under Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s roof.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t for a year had
much time to think of her, but my imagination had had ground for lodging
her in more gilded halls.&nbsp; One of the last things I had heard before
leaving England was that in commemoration of the new relationship she
had gone to stay with Lady Considine.&nbsp; This had made me take everything
else for granted, and the noisy American world had deafened my care
to possible contradictions.&nbsp; Her spectacles were at present a direct
contradiction; they seemed a negation not only of new relationships
but of every old one as well.&nbsp; I remember nevertheless that when
after a moment she walked beside me on the grass I found myself nervously
hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful;
so that to stave off this danger I harried her with questions about
Mrs. Meldrum and, without waiting for replies, became profuse on the
subject of my own doings.&nbsp; My companion was finely silent, and
I felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister
irony and as if I were talking to some different and strange person.&nbsp;
Flora plain and obscure and dumb was no Flora at all.&nbsp; At Mrs.
Meldrum&rsquo;s door she turned off with the observation that as there
was certainly a great deal I should have to say to our friend she had
better not go in with me.&nbsp; I looked at her again&mdash;I had been
keeping my eyes away from her&mdash;but only to meet her magnified stare.&nbsp;
I greatly desired in truth to see Mrs. Meldrum alone, but there was
something so grim in the girl&rsquo;s trouble that I hesitated to fall
in with this idea of dropping her.&nbsp; Yet one couldn&rsquo;t express
a compassion without seeming to take for granted more trouble than there
actually might have been.&nbsp; I reflected that I must really figure
to her as a fool, which was an entertainment I had never expected to
give her.&nbsp; It rolled over me there for the first time&mdash;it
has come back to me since&mdash;that there is, wondrously, in very deep
and even in very foolish misfortune a dignity still finer than in the
most inveterate habit of being all right.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have
to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that I was face to
face with a part of what, at our last meeting, we had had such a scene
about; but while I was trying to think of some manner that I <i>could</i>
have she said quite colourlessly, though somehow as if she might never
see me again: &ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to take my walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked round the great bleak cliff-top.&nbsp; &ldquo;With whom
should I go?&nbsp; Besides I like to be alone&mdash;for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement
as temporary, and the confidence came to me that she would never, for
her happiness, cease to be a creature of illusions.&nbsp; It enabled
me to exclaim, smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic: &ldquo;Oh
I shall see you again!&nbsp; But I hope you&rsquo;ll have a very pleasant
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my walks are pleasant, thank you&mdash;they do me such
a lot of good.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was as quiet as a mouse, and her words
seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take several
a day,&rdquo; she continued.&nbsp; She might have been an ancient woman
responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the
parson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more I take the better I feel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for
plenty of exercise.&nbsp; It keeps up my general health, you know, and
if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon
be all right.&nbsp; All that was the matter with me before&mdash;and
always; it was too reckless!&mdash;was that I neglected my general health.&nbsp;
It acts directly on the state of the particular organ.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m
going three miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grinned at her from the doorstep while Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s maid
stood there to admit me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; I
said, looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had
kept and remembering the day when, while she rejoined Lord Iffield,
I had indulged in the same observation.&nbsp; Her air of assurance was
on this occasion not less than it had been on that; but I recalled that
she had then struck me as marching off to her doom.&nbsp; Was she really
now marching away from it?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>As soon as I saw Mrs. Meldrum I of course broke out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
there anything in it?&nbsp; <i>Is</i> her general health&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Meldrum checked me with her great amused blare.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
&lsquo;in it&rsquo; is what has been in everything she has ever done&mdash;the
most comical, tragical belief in herself.&nbsp; She thinks she&rsquo;s
doing a &lsquo;cure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does her husband think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband?&nbsp; What husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she then married Lord Iffield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vous-en-&ecirc;tes l&agrave;?&rdquo; cried my hostess.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why he behaved like a regular beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&nbsp; You never wrote me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Meldrum hesitated, covering me with what poor Flora called the
particular organ.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t write you&mdash;I
abstained on purpose.&nbsp; If I kept quiet I thought you mightn&rsquo;t
hear over there what had happened.&nbsp; If you should hear I was afraid
you would stir up Mr. Dawling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stir him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urge him to fly to the rescue; write out to him that there
was another chance for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mrs. Meldrum replied, &ldquo;it was not my business
to give you an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short you were afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy I thought
she considerably reddened.&nbsp; At all events she laughed out.&nbsp;
Then &ldquo;I was afraid of it!&rdquo; she very honestly answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t he know?&nbsp; Has he given no sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every sign in life&mdash;he came straight back to her.&nbsp;
He did everything to get her to listen to him, but she hasn&rsquo;t
the smallest idea of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he seen her as she is now?&rdquo; I presently and just
a trifle awkwardly enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed he has, and borne it like a hero.&nbsp; He told me
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much you&rsquo;ve all been through!&rdquo; I found occasion
to remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what has become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at home in Hampshire.&nbsp; He has got back his
old place and I believe by this time his old sisters.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not half a bad little place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet its attractions say nothing to Flora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Flora&rsquo;s by no means on her back!&rdquo; my fried
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not on her back because she&rsquo;s on yours.&nbsp;
Have you got her for the rest of your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more Mrs. Meldrum genially glared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did she tell
you how much the Hammond Synges have kindly left her to live on?&nbsp;
Not quite eighty pounds a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good deal, but it won&rsquo;t pay the oculist.&nbsp;
What was it that at last induced her to submit to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her general collapse after that brute of an Iffield&rsquo;s
rupture.&nbsp; She cried her eyes out&mdash;she passed through a horror
of black darkness.&nbsp; Then came a gleam of light, and the light appears
to have broadened.&nbsp; She went into goggles as repentant Magdalens
go into the Catholic church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of which you don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll be saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> thinks she will&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I can tell
you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no doubt that when once she brought herself
to accept her real remedy, as she calls it, she began to enjoy a relief
that she had never known.&nbsp; That feeling, very new and in spite
of what she pays for it most refreshing, has given her something to
hold on by, begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that, as she
says, she&rsquo;s on the mend and that in the course of time, if she
leads a tremendously healthy life, she&rsquo;ll be able to take off
her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever.&nbsp; It keeps her
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what keeps you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re good until the parties
begin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh she doesn&rsquo;t object to me now!&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Meldrum.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take her abroad; we shall be
a pretty pair.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was struck with this energy and after
a moment I enquired the reason of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to divert
her mind,&rdquo; my friend replied, reddening again a little, I thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall go next week: I&rsquo;ve only waited to see how your
mother would be before starting.&rdquo;&nbsp; I expressed to her hereupon
my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability
of Flora&rsquo;s fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at
the chance of marrying a man like Dawling.&nbsp; &ldquo;She says he&rsquo;s
too ugly; she says he&rsquo;s too dreary; she says in fact he&rsquo;s
&lsquo;nobody,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mrs. Meldrum pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
says above all that he&rsquo;s not &lsquo;her own sort.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She doesn&rsquo;t deny that he&rsquo;s good, but she finds him impossibly
ridiculous.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s quite the last person she would ever dream
of.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that
if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps
served her right; but after a while my curiosity as to just how her
noble suitor <i>had</i> served her got the better of that emotion, and
I asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him
the invidious term I have already quoted.&nbsp; What had happened was
simply that Flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt
to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his
lordship&rsquo;s interest in her had not been proof against the discovery
of the way she had practised on him.&nbsp; Her dissimulation, he was
obliged to perceive, had been infernally deep.&nbsp; The future in short
assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses
of a bride who, as he had said to some one, couldn&rsquo;t really, when
you came to find out, see her hand before her face.&nbsp; He had conducted
himself like any other jockeyed customer&mdash;he had returned the animal
as unsound.&nbsp; He had backed out in his own way, giving the business,
by some sharp shuffle, such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly
Flora&rsquo;s, but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed
out.&nbsp; He had cared for her lovely face, cared for it in the amused
and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men
care; and her lovely face, damn it, with the monstrous gear she had
begun to rig upon it, was just what had let him in.&nbsp; He had in
the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of
him; he had made&mdash;Mrs. Meldrum had herself seen the letter&mdash;a
&ldquo;handsome&rdquo; offer of pecuniary compensation.&nbsp; Oh if
Flora, with her incredible buoyancy, was in a manner on her feet again
now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the
dust.&nbsp; Strange were the humiliations, the forms of anguish, it
was given some natures to survive.&nbsp; That Flora had survived was
perhaps after all a proof she was reserved for some final mercy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But she has been in the abysses at any rate,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Meldrum, &ldquo;and I really don&rsquo;t think I can tell you what pulled
her through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can tell <i>you</i>,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
in the world but Mrs. Meldrum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of an hour Flora had not come in, and I was obliged to
announce that I should have but time to reach the station, where I was
to find my luggage in charge of my mother&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; Mrs.
Meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train, so
as not to lose our young lady, but I confess I gave this alternative
a consideration less acute than I pretended.&nbsp; Somehow I didn&rsquo;t
care if I did lose our young lady.&nbsp; Now that I knew the worst that
had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on
the ground of condolence; and with the sad appearance she wore to me
what other ground was left?&nbsp; I lost her, but I caught my train.&nbsp;
In truth she was so changed that one hated to see it; and now that she
was in charitable hands one didn&rsquo;t feel compelled to make great
efforts.&nbsp; I had studied her face for a particular beauty; I had
lived with that beauty and reproduced it; but I knew what belonged to
my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>I was soon called back to Folkestone; but Mrs. Meldrum and her young
friend had already left England, finding to that end every convenience
on the spot and not having had to come up to town.&nbsp; My thoughts
however were so painfully engaged there that I should in any case have
had little attention for them: the event occurred that was to bring
my series of visits to a close.&nbsp; When this high tide had ebbed
I returned to America and to my interrupted work, which had opened out
on such a scale that, with a deep plunge into a great chance, I was
three good years in rising again to the surface.&nbsp; There are nymphs
and naiads moreover in the American depths: they may have had something
to do with the duration of my dive.&nbsp; I mention them to account
for a grave misdemeanor&mdash;the fact that after the first year I rudely
neglected Mrs. Meldrum.&nbsp; She had written to me from Florence after
my mother&rsquo;s death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our
young lady&rsquo;s calculations the lowest figures were now Italian
counts.&nbsp; This was a good omen, and if in subsequent letters there
was no news of a sequel I was content to accept small things and to
believe that grave tidings, should there be any, would come to me in
due course.&nbsp; The gravity of what might happen to a featherweight
became indeed with time and distance less appreciable, and I was not
without an impression that Mrs. Meldrum, whose sense of proportion was
not the least of her merits, had no idea of boring the world with the
ups and downs of her pensioner.&nbsp; The poor girl grew dusky and dim,
a small fitful memory, a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness
of how kind Mrs. Meldrum would always be to her.&nbsp; I was professionally
more preoccupied than I had ever been, and I had swarms of pretty faces
in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears.&nbsp; Geoffrey Dawling
had on his return to England written me two or three letters: his last
information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy.&nbsp;
I was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go
into figures they would, as they are said to be able to prove anything,
prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time
enough.&nbsp; This quickened on my part another hope, a hope suggested
by some roundabout rumour&mdash;I forget how it reached me&mdash;that
he was engaged to a girl down in Hampshire.&nbsp; He turned out not
to be, but I felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough
he would become, among the girls down in Hampshire or elsewhere, one
of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not
on the scale of their provocations.&nbsp; I nursed in short the thought
that it was probably open to him to develop as one of the types about
whom, as the years go on, superficial critics wonder without relief
how they ever succeeded in dragging a bride to the altar.&nbsp; He never
alluded to Flora Saunt; and there was in his silence about her, quite
as in Mrs. Meldrum&rsquo;s, an element of instinctive tact, a brief
implication that if you didn&rsquo;t happen to have been in love with
her there was nothing to be said.</p>
<p>Within a week after my return to London I went to the opera, of which
I had always been much of a devotee.&nbsp; I arrived too late for the
first act of &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; but the second was just beginning,
and I gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house.&nbsp;
When it was over I treated myself, with my glass, from my place in the
stalls, to a general survey of the boxes, making doubtless on their
contents the reflections, pointed by comparison, that are most familiar
to the wanderer restored to London.&nbsp; There was the common sprinkling
of pretty women, but I suddenly noted that one of these was far prettier
than the others.&nbsp; This lady, alone in one of the smaller receptacles
of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses, which
she sustained with admirable serenity, this single exquisite figure,
placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall, was a person,
I immediately felt, to cause one&rsquo;s curiosity to linger.&nbsp;
Dressed in white, with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck,
she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her
a distinguished presence and, with the air that easily attaches to lonely
loveliness in public places, an agreeable mystery.&nbsp; A mystery however
she remained to me only for a minute after I had levelled my glass at
her: I feel to this moment the startled thrill, the shock almost of
joy, with which I translated her vague brightness into a resurrection
of Flora.&nbsp; I say a resurrection, because, to put it crudely, I
had on that last occasion left our young woman for dead.&nbsp; At present
perfectly alive again, she was altered only, as it were, by this fact
of life.&nbsp; A little older, a little quieter, a little finer and
a good deal fairer, she was simply transfigured by having recovered.&nbsp;
Sustained by the reflection that even her recovery wouldn&rsquo;t enable
her to distinguish me in the crowd, I was free to look at her well.&nbsp;
Then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles
had been cruelly final.&nbsp; As her beauty was all there was of her,
that machinery had extinguished her, and so far as I had thought of
her in the interval I had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern
specialist had built.&nbsp; With the sense that she had escaped from
it came a lively wish to return to her; and if I didn&rsquo;t straightway
leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because
I was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability
to cease looking at her.</p>
<p>She had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless,
leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her
eyes vaguely directed, as it seemed on me, to one of the boxes on my
side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight.&nbsp;
The only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved
hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck,
which my glass showed me to be large and splendid.&nbsp; Her diamonds
and pearls, in her solitude, mystified me, making me, as she had had
no such brave jewels in the days of the Hammond Synges, wonder what
undreamt-of improvement had taken place in her fortunes.&nbsp; The ghost
of a question hovered there a moment: could anything so prodigious have
happened as that on her tested and proved amendment Lord Iffield had
taken her back?&nbsp; This could scarce have without my hearing of it;
and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the
little court one would naturally see at her elbow?&nbsp; Her isolation
was puzzling, though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily
alone.&nbsp; If she had come with Mrs. Meldrum that lady would have
taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box&mdash;doubtless
the box at which Flora had just been looking.&nbsp; Mrs. Meldrum didn&rsquo;t
account for the jewels, but the revival of Flora&rsquo;s beauty accounted
for anything.&nbsp; She presently moved her eyes over the house, and
I felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last
see me.&nbsp; She did see me: she suddenly bent forward to take up the
little double-barrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box
and to all appearance fix me with it.&nbsp; I smiled from my place straight
up at the searching lenses, and after an instant she dropped them and
smiled as straight back at me.&nbsp; Oh her smile&mdash;it was her old
smile, her young smile, her very own smile made perfect!&nbsp; I instantly
left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it; quite flushed,
I remember, as I went with the annoyance of having happened to think
of the idiotic way I had tried to paint her.&nbsp; Poor Iffield with
his sample of that error, and still poorer Dawling in particular with
<i>his</i>!&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t touched her, I was professionally humiliated,
and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me I felt that
the very first thing I should have to say to her would be that she must
absolutely sit to me again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>She gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder, from her chair,
she turned her face to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here you are again!&rdquo; she
exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to
take.&nbsp; I dropped into a chair just behind her and, having taken
it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration
sufficiently private, bent my lips over it and impressed them on its
finger-tips.&nbsp; It was given me however, to my astonishment, to feel
next that all the privacy in the world couldn&rsquo;t have sufficed
to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of
my moustache: the blood had jumped to her face, she quickly recovered
her hand and jerked at me, twisting herself round, a vacant challenging
stare.&nbsp; During the next few instants several extraordinary things
happened, the first of which was that now I was close to them the eyes
of loveliness I had come up to look into didn&rsquo;t show at all the
conscious light I had just been pleased to see them flash across the
house: they showed on the contrary, to my confusion, a strange sweet
blankness, an expression I failed to give a meaning to until, without
delay, I felt on my arm, directed to it as if instantly to efface the
effect of her start, the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched
from me.&nbsp; It was the irrepressible question in this grasp that
stopped on my lips all sound of salutation.&nbsp; She had mistaken my
entrance for that of another person, a pair of lips without a moustache.&nbsp;
She was feeling me to see who I was!&nbsp; With the perception of this
and of her not seeing me I sat gaping at her and at the wild word that
didn&rsquo;t come, the right word to express or to disguise my dismay.&nbsp;
What was the right word to commemorate one&rsquo;s sudden discovery,
at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count
on better things, that one&rsquo;s dear old friend had gone blind?&nbsp;
Before the answer to this question dropped upon me&mdash;and the moving
moments, though few, seemed many&mdash;I heard, with the sound of voices,
the click of the attendant&rsquo;s key on the other side of the door.&nbsp;
Poor Flora heard also and on hearing, still with her hand on my arm,
brightened again as I had a minute since seen her brighten across the
house: she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me
for&mdash;the person with the right pair of lips, as to whom I was for
that matter much more in the dark than she.&nbsp; I gasped, but my word
had come: if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she
had found again her beauty.&nbsp; I managed to speak while we were still
alone, before her companion had appeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life!&rdquo;&nbsp;
At the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience
broke into audible joy.&nbsp; She sprang up, recognising me, always
holding me, and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the
doorway by the sight of me: &ldquo;He has come back, he has come back,
and you should have heard what he says of me!&rdquo;&nbsp; The gentleman
was Geoffrey Dawling, and I thought it best to let him hear on the spot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How beautiful she is, my dear man&mdash;but how extraordinarily
beautiful!&nbsp; More beautiful at this hour than ever, ever before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave them almost equal pleasure and made Dawling blush to his
eyes; while this in turn produced, in spite of deepened astonishment,
a blest snap of the strain I had been struggling with.&nbsp; I wanted
to embrace them both, and while the opening bars of another scene rose
from the orchestra I almost did embrace Dawling, whose first emotion
on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of
guilt.&nbsp; I had caught him somehow in the act, though that was as
yet all I knew; but by the time we sank noiselessly into our chairs
again&mdash;for the music was supreme, Wagner passed first&mdash;my
demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism
he had to fear.&nbsp; I myself indeed, while the opera blazed, was only
too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of
my optimism, which was simply the comfort I had gathered from seeing
that if our companion&rsquo;s beauty lived again her vanity partook
of its life.&nbsp; I had hit on the right note&mdash;that was what eased
me off: it drew all pain for the next half-hour from the sense of the
deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat.&nbsp; If the music, in
that darkness, happily soared and swelled for her, it beat its wings
in unison with those of a gratified passion.&nbsp; A great deal came
and went between us without profaning the occasion, so that I could
feel at the end of twenty minutes as if I knew almost everything he
might in kindness have to tell me; knew even why Flora, while I stared
at her from the stalls, had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal
and by appearing to recognise me and smile.&nbsp; She leaned back in
her chair in luxurious ease: I had from the first become aware that
the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state.&nbsp;
Nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance, but I hadn&rsquo;t
then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as
a married woman.&nbsp; She had taken him when everything had failed;
he had taken her when she herself had done so.&nbsp; His embarrassed
eyes confessed it all, confessed the deep peace he found in it.&nbsp;
They only didn&rsquo;t tell me why he had not written to me, nor clear
up as yet a minor obscurity.&nbsp; Flora after a while again lifted
the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with
it.&nbsp; Then, by the mere instinct of her grace, a motion but half
conscious, she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a
salute, producing, I could see, a perfect imitation of response to some
homage.&nbsp; Dawling and I looked at each other again; the tears came
into his eyes.&nbsp; She was playing at perfection still, and her misfortune
only simplified the process.</p>
<p>I recognised that this was as near as I should ever come, certainly
as I should come that night, to pressing on her misfortune.&nbsp; Neither
of us would name it more than we were doing then, and Flora would never
name it at all.&nbsp; Little by little I saw that what had occurred
was, strange as it might appear, the best thing for her happiness.&nbsp;
The question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled
at; with Dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited
to that.&nbsp; Such an activity was all within her scope; it asked nothing
of her that she couldn&rsquo;t splendidly give.&nbsp; As from time to
time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody
of a look I lost none of the signs of its strange new glory.&nbsp; The
expression of the eyes was a rub of pastel from a master&rsquo;s thumb;
the whole head, stamped with a sort of showy suffering, had gained a
fineness from what she had passed through.&nbsp; Yes, Flora was settled
for life&mdash;nothing could hurt her further.&nbsp; I foresaw the particular
praise she would mostly incur&mdash;she would be invariably &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with
her pleasure.&nbsp; For herself above all she was fixed for ever, rescued
from all change and ransomed from all doubt.&nbsp; Her old certainties,
her old vanities were justified and sanctified, and in the darkness
that had closed upon her one object remained clear.&nbsp; That object,
as unfading as a mosaic mask, was fortunately the loveliest she could
possibly look upon.&nbsp; The greatest blessing of all was of course
that Dawling thought so.&nbsp; Her future was ruled with the straightest
line, and so for that matter was his.&nbsp; There were two facts to
which before I left my friends I gave time to sink into my spirit.&nbsp;
One was that he had changed by some process as effective as Flora&rsquo;s
change, had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified
into success.&nbsp; He was such a picture of inspired intervention as
I had never yet conceived: he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose
of rendering unnecessary, or rather impossible, any reference even on
her own part to his wife&rsquo;s infirmity.&nbsp; Oh yes, how little
desire he would ever give <i>me</i> to refer to it!&nbsp; He principally
after a while made me feel&mdash;and this was my second lesson&mdash;that,
good-natured as he was, my being there to see it all oppressed him;
so that by the time the act ended I recognised that I too had filled
out my hour.&nbsp; Dawling remembered things; I think he caught in my
very face the irony of old judgments: they made him thresh about in
his chair.&nbsp; I said to Flora as I took leave of her that I would
come to see her, but I may mention that I never went.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
go to-morrow if I hear she wants me; but what in the world can she ever
want?&nbsp; As I quitted them I laid my hand on Dawling&rsquo;s arm,
and drew him for a moment into the lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you never write to me of your marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled uncomfortably, showing his long yellow teeth and something
more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;the whole thing gave me
such a tremendous lot to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first dishonest speech I had heard him make: he really
hadn&rsquo;t written because an idea that I would think him a still
bigger fool than before.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t insist, but I tried there
in the lobby, so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me, to give
him a notion of what I thought him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t at any
rate make out,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why I didn&rsquo;t hear from Mrs.
Meldrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t write to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a word.&nbsp; What has become of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s at Folkestone,&rdquo; Dawling returned;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry to say that practically she has ceased to
see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quarrelled with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>could</i> we?&nbsp; Think of all we owe her.&nbsp;
At the time of our marriage, and for months before, she did everything
for us: I don&rsquo;t know how we should have managed without her.&nbsp;
But since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly
little encouragement to keep up relations with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was struck with this, though of course I admit I am struck with
all sorts of things.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said after a moment,
&ldquo;even if I could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn&rsquo;t
explain why she shouldn&rsquo;t have taken account of my natural interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dawling&rsquo;s face was a windowless
wall.&nbsp; He could contribute nothing to the mystery and, quitting
him, I carried it away.&nbsp; It was not till I went down to ace Mrs.
Meldrum that was really dispelled.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want to hear
of them or to talk of them, not a bit, and it was just in the same spirit
that she hadn&rsquo;t wanted to write of them.&nbsp; She had done everything
in the world for them, but now, thank heaven, the hard business was
over.&nbsp; After I had taken this in, which I was quick to do, we quite
avoided the subject.&nbsp; She simply couldn&rsquo;t bear it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
