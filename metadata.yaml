description: James' "Glasses" is about a beautiful young woman, Flora Saunt, so vain
  that she refuses to wear glasses. Failing to conceal her deteriorating eyesight
  from her aristocratic suitor, she is forced to marry a rejected lover who, himself
  blinded by love, has fallen for her "at first sight". By marrying her he allows
  her, now totally blind, to continue to pose without the disfigurement of glasses.
